# cl-art

Learning common lisp sketch.

# Description

Common lisp is a great programming language despite all the bad parts.

I've always wanted to do generative art so I'm gonna use this.

# Dependencies

get all the [sketch](https://github.com/vydd/sketch#installation) dependencies.

# Usage

I learned about [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) and I think I'm gonna use it for everything from now on.
This package can be downloaded and installed via roswell. It will even take care of the sbcl version issue! 

```bash
ros install sbcl/2.0.11
ros install DrAtomic/learn-sketch
ros run
(ql:quickload "cl-art")
```
